 wait let me see so you can ask them to waive this on the banking side but when it returns it’ll probably stop your auto pay ‘cause when we cut the auto pay off the system thinks it’s having problems but you can call us to make sure it’s functioning so you aren’t late for your next bill
 my parents are usaa members and i wanna get on their insurance they told me to call and get a quote and see what i need to do
 sometimes they will deposit or mail the money to you so you can take the funds and repair your car at any facility you choose
so i don't have any idea what card or what's happening with it so i can't even really tell you more than <unk> i got a fraud alert from you guys
so um it may incur a return payment fee and i can get you over to our banking team 'cause you are with usaa so i get you over our banking team and see if there's anything that they can do um probably what they're gonna tell you is to let it go through and then they'll return it
