and when i try to like re like reset my username like saying that i forgot it like click the forgot username it has you type in like your phone number thats linked to the account and i typed in me and my husbands phone number cause like it and it wouldnt recognize either of them
but it just startled me when they were when i got this and then you know i got the call about my daughter and son in law and they called and they said they had no idea so i wanted to make sure it wasnt on my account
okay so a lot of people get confused even though you have joint accounts um each member has their own online access
we could transfer money into my usaa checking account when i need it
and then i have a totally separate question after we get that done
