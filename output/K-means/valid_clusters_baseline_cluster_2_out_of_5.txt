 i’m frustrated because i just wanna be done with them but i can’t get done
 my computer might have gotten messed up when i moved because it worked fine yesterday and earlier today but now that i restarted it it’s asking to diagnose my problems and reset it
 they told me I had a visa earlier
last time i did it online
so you're the third person that i talked to you so hopefully i don't get transferred again but
