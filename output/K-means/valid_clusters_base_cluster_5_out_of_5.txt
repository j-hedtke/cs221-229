 you may get a return payment fee but i can transfer you to the banking team since you’re with usaa and they can see what to do though they’ll probably tell you is to just let the fee charge and then they’ll return the money to you
 when the card’s prompted nothing will go through until we reactivate it but if your charges are valid i can reactivate the card and it won’t give you anymore trouble
they should have record of the total loss i'm just really confused by why they're they're making it such a hard time for you
uhm i'm still hoping that <unk> if it wasn't raining i would take my motorcycle just bypass all the the traffic that's usually what i do when i drive to sac
or sometimes they can issue payment in your name and um have it deposited or mailed to you uhm for you to take those funds and have the vehicle repaired at a at any facility of your choice
