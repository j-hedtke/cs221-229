Naturally the stronglysupervised models perform better than weaklysupervised ones While our weaklysupervised results are encouraging given the minimal amount of annotated data they require we still believe more research is needed to help minimize the performance gap between weakly and stronglysupervised models
This architecture performs well for semantic segmentation tasks and outputs a prediction that matches the size of the network input
We use of our training data for validation and we train all our models until convergence
