they should have record of the total loss i'm just really confused by why they're they're making it such a hard time for you
 sometimes they will deposit or mail the money to you so you can take the funds and repair your car at any facility you choose
 when the card’s prompted nothing will go through until we reactivate it but if your charges are valid i can reactivate the card and it won’t give you anymore trouble
super wild okay and then they're now they're also requesting uhm a declarations page for your um new policy here at usaa is that right
alright so what is this new address that we speak of
