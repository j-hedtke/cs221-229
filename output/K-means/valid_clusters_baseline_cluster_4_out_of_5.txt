 i tried resetting my username by clicking the forgot username and when it prompted me to enter my phone number linked to the account i put me and my husband’s number and it wouldn’t recognize either of them
 i don’t see any security alerts or recent transactions on your card which is in normal status and your account is active and able to be used right now you haven’t used your card today right
so this is uh your account is still active and available for immediate use your card is a normal status i don't see any security alerts um or um recent transactions that are pending so you haven't used your credit card today at all correct
 i wanna switch it from my checking account to my credit card ‘cause it’s more than i thought it would be
 we have an online account set up i was trying to log in on the app and i haven’t logged in before ‘causei don’t know what my username and password is
