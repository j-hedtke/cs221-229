yeah [laughter] well we'll we'll see uh it might get bumped up to that soon just because of the uh i just got hired in atwater so i might have to commute to atwater 	[' i tried resetting my username by clicking the forgot username and when it prompted me to enter my phone number linked to the account i put me and my husband’s number and it wouldn’t recognize either of them', ' we have an online account set up i was trying to log in on the app and i haven’t logged in before ‘causei don’t know what my username and password is', ' you may get a return payment fee but i can transfer you to the banking team since you’re with usaa and they can see what to do though they’ll probably tell you is to just let the fee charge and then they’ll return the money to you', ' hey i need to make sure my insurances are listed on the new address i just changed usaa just notified me to call in', ' they’ll contact our insured and the driver theresa to get the information you just gave us and a recorded statement of what happened and how to assess liability and when liability is assessed if our driver is at fault and there’s adequate coverage they will offer repairs to you and your vehicle']

so in this case i mean she's just a young operator they're just gonna charge you like she was um gonna be involved in an accident until she can prove otherwise so unfortunately that's why it's so expensive	[' it’s expensive because she’s a young operator and they will charge you as if she’s gonna be in an accident until she can show otherwise', ' wait let me see so you can ask them to waive this on the banking side but when it returns it’ll probably stop your auto pay ‘cause when we cut the auto pay off the system thinks it’s having problems but you can call us to make sure it’s functioning so you aren’t late for your next bill', ' we have an online account set up i was trying to log in on the app and i haven’t logged in before ‘causei don’t know what my username and password is', ' i tried resetting my username by clicking the forgot username and when it prompted me to enter my phone number linked to the account i put me and my husband’s number and it wouldn’t recognize either of them', ' i was a little alarmed when i got this alert and they mentioned my daughter and son in law who called and had no idea so i wanna make sure this is not regarding my account']

i don't really want her touching my car but in an emergency though i mean she can she still drive it	[' i don’t want her to use my car but can she still drive it in an emergency', ' i didn’t have enough money in my account today for the car loan so my account is showing negative and the transaction is still pending', ' i wanna switch it from my checking account to my credit card ‘cause it’s more than i thought it would be', ' i don’t think there will be an extension here but they can be placed sometimes for deployment or things like that', ' my card is being declined here at the grocery store but i know i have enough money on it']
so um it may incur a return payment fee and i can get you over to our banking team 'cause you are with usaa so i get you over our banking team and see if there's anything that they can do um probably what they're gonna tell you is to let it go through and then they'll return it	[' you may get a return payment fee but i can transfer you to the banking team since you’re with usaa and they can see what to do though they’ll probably tell you is to just let the fee charge and then they’ll return the money to you', ' wait let me see so you can ask them to waive this on the banking side but when it returns it’ll probably stop your auto pay ‘cause when we cut the auto pay off the system thinks it’s having problems but you can call us to make sure it’s functioning so you aren’t late for your next bill', ' they’ll contact our insured and the driver theresa to get the information you just gave us and a recorded statement of what happened and how to assess liability and when liability is assessed if our driver is at fault and there’s adequate coverage they will offer repairs to you and your vehicle', ' i tried resetting my username by clicking the forgot username and when it prompted me to enter my phone number linked to the account i put me and my husband’s number and it wouldn’t recognize either of them', ' i don’t see any security alerts or recent transactions on your card which is in normal status and your account is active and able to be used right now you haven’t used your card today right']
um you can ask them to waive it on the banking side but what i was gonna say was when it returns it'll probably well wait wait wait wait wait um let me see <unk> okay so when it returns it'll probably go ahead and um cut off your auto pay because whenever an account does it comes back and you know has the issue we cut off the auto pay <unk> the system just assumes it's you know broken so you can go ahead and just give us a call and just make sure everything's set up properly still so you don't end up going past due on the next bill okay	[' wait let me see so you can ask them to waive this on the banking side but when it returns it’ll probably stop your auto pay ‘cause when we cut the auto pay off the system thinks it’s having problems but you can call us to make sure it’s functioning so you aren’t late for your next bill', ' they’ll contact our insured and the driver theresa to get the information you just gave us and a recorded statement of what happened and how to assess liability and when liability is assessed if our driver is at fault and there’s adequate coverage they will offer repairs to you and your vehicle', ' you may get a return payment fee but i can transfer you to the banking team since you’re with usaa and they can see what to do though they’ll probably tell you is to just let the fee charge and then they’ll return the money to you', ' i tried resetting my username by clicking the forgot username and when it prompted me to enter my phone number linked to the account i put me and my husband’s number and it wouldn’t recognize either of them', ' i was on the line with a guy and i don’t know if he put me on hold while he was checking something ‘cause the recording came on and then i lost him i dunno if he’s still on the other line']
