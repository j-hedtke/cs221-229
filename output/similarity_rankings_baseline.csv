and does anybody need to be listed as an additional insured, do we need to list anyone as an additional insured, quick question are there any other licensed drivers living with you who should be insured on this policy, they’ll contact our insured and the driver theresa to get the information you just gave us and a recorded statement of what happened and how to assess liability and when liability is assessed if our driver is at fault and there’s adequate coverage they will offer repairs to you and your vehicle, it’s expensive because she’s a young operator and they will charge you as if she’s gonna be in an accident until she can show otherwise, i don’t think there will be an extension here but they can be placed sometimes for deployment or things like that
what i'll do is i'll go ahead and send that off then i'm gonna actually have to review it first but you should get it within the next few minutes, i need to review that before i send it to you but you will get it in the next few minutes, i need to put in the pin you think it is first and then i can see if it goes in i’m more than happy to help you out here, wait let me see so you can ask them to waive this on the banking side but when it returns it’ll probably stop your auto pay ‘cause when we cut the auto pay off the system thinks it’s having problems but you can call us to make sure it’s functioning so you aren’t late for your next bill, they say they won’t take an email but i’m just gonna forward it to them will you send that to me, i can pay it all at once if I get the money next month
um and then once you get it uh let me know if you want to open it and let me know that it looks good for ya uhm so that way you don't have to call back, open it once you get it to let me know it looks good so you won’t need to call back, don’t worry about it sir it happens to me too so i understand how that is if you have any other issues don’t hesitate to give us a call, i need to put in the pin you think it is first and then i can see if it goes in i’m more than happy to help you out here, i like talking to people like you who aren’t with usaa so i can explain what’ll happen ‘cause some people don’t get it as readily as you did, they say they won’t take an email but i’m just gonna forward it to them will you send that to me
<unk> whenthat expires <unk> does that automatically just renew or do i have to call and do something, do i have to call when that expires of does it renew by itself, it automatically renews so you don’t have to call unless you want it to cancel, when the card’s prompted nothing will go through until we reactivate it but if your charges are valid i can reactivate the card and it won’t give you anymore trouble, you may get a return payment fee but i can transfer you to the banking team since you’re with usaa and they can see what to do though they’ll probably tell you is to just let the fee charge and then they’ll return the money to you, wait let me see so you can ask them to waive this on the banking side but when it returns it’ll probably stop your auto pay ‘cause when we cut the auto pay off the system thinks it’s having problems but you can call us to make sure it’s functioning so you aren’t late for your next bill
yeah great question you actually never have to call to renew something it'll automatically renew unless you want it to cancel and then you just call us and tell us, it automatically renews so you don’t have to call unless you want it to cancel, open it once you get it to let me know it looks good so you won’t need to call back, don’t worry about it sir it happens to me too so i understand how that is if you have any other issues don’t hesitate to give us a call, wait let me see so you can ask them to waive this on the banking side but when it returns it’ll probably stop your auto pay ‘cause when we cut the auto pay off the system thinks it’s having problems but you can call us to make sure it’s functioning so you aren’t late for your next bill, they say they won’t take an email but i’m just gonna forward it to them will you send that to me

so in this case i mean she's just a young operator they're just gonna charge you like she was um gonna be involved in an accident until she can prove otherwise so unfortunately that's why it's so expensive, it’s expensive because she’s a young operator and they will charge you as if she’s gonna be in an accident until she can show otherwise, i need to put in the pin you think it is first and then i can see if it goes in i’m more than happy to help you out here, i like talking to people like you who aren’t with usaa so i can explain what’ll happen ‘cause some people don’t get it as readily as you did, open it once you get it to let me know it looks good so you won’t need to call back, don’t worry about it sir it happens to me too so i understand how that is if you have any other issues don’t hesitate to give us a call

so um it may incur a return payment fee and i can get you over to our banking team 'cause you are with usaa so i get you over our banking team and see if there's anything that they can do um probably what they're gonna tell you is to let it go through and then they'll return it, you may get a return payment fee but i can transfer you to the banking team since you’re with usaa and they can see what to do though they’ll probably tell you is to just let the fee charge and then they’ll return the money to you, i need to put in the pin you think it is first and then i can see if it goes in i’m more than happy to help you out here, wait let me see so you can ask them to waive this on the banking side but when it returns it’ll probably stop your auto pay ‘cause when we cut the auto pay off the system thinks it’s having problems but you can call us to make sure it’s functioning so you aren’t late for your next bill, once i’m in your account i can give you a temporary pin and afterwards you can make your own we can do it like that, open it once you get it to let me know it looks good so you won’t need to call back
um you can ask them to waive it on the banking side but what i was gonna say was when it returns it'll probably well wait wait wait wait wait um let me see <unk> okay so when it returns it'll probably go ahead and um cut off your auto pay because whenever an account does it comes back and you know has the issue we cut off the auto pay <unk> the system just assumes it's you know broken so you can go ahead and just give us a call and just make sure everything's set up properly still so you don't end up going past due on the next bill okay, wait let me see so you can ask them to waive this on the banking side but when it returns it’ll probably stop your auto pay ‘cause when we cut the auto pay off the system thinks it’s having problems but you can call us to make sure it’s functioning so you aren’t late for your next bill, open it once you get it to let me know it looks good so you won’t need to call back, i need to put in the pin you think it is first and then i can see if it goes in i’m more than happy to help you out here, you may get a return payment fee but i can transfer you to the banking team since you’re with usaa and they can see what to do though they’ll probably tell you is to just let the fee charge and then they’ll return the money to you, i need to review that before i send it to you but you will get it in the next few minutes

yesterday it worked fine and then today earlier today it was fine and now it i restarted it and then it asked to diagnose my problems and then after that it now it's wanting me to reset my p c so i'm not sure if it was damaged when i moved or anything like that but, my computer might have gotten messed up when i moved because it worked fine yesterday and earlier today but now that i restarted it it’s asking to diagnose my problems and reset it, i was on the line with a guy and i don’t know if he put me on hold while he was checking something ‘cause the recording came on and then i lost him i dunno if he’s still on the other line, i’m not worried this isn’t the first time this has happened to me i was hit two times last year if you can believe it, i need to put in the pin you think it is first and then i can see if it goes in i’m more than happy to help you out here, okay thank you how can i get the tracking information for that because usaa said they would email it to me but never did
i haven't even opened the door yet because i'm worried that if i opened it 'cause it's all indentated that it may not close so i'm just leaving it as is, the door is all indentated and i’m not even opening it ‘cause i’m worried that it may not close so i’m leaving it alone, i don’t know why they’re making it so difficult for you they should have the total loss on record, i’m not worried this isn’t the first time this has happened to me i was hit two times last year if you can believe it, i need to put in the pin you think it is first and then i can see if it goes in i’m more than happy to help you out here, i don’t think there will be an extension here but they can be placed sometimes for deployment or things like that
as to what occurred and how it happened things like that they'll also reach out to our insured and theresa the driver as well to obtain the same information you know get a recorded statement as to what occurred and how it happened to help determine liability uh now if and when liability is determined if our driver is found to be at fault and there is the adequate coverages uh they would then offer repairs uh to you for your vehicle, they’ll contact our insured and the driver theresa to get the information you just gave us and a recorded statement of what happened and how to assess liability and when liability is assessed if our driver is at fault and there’s adequate coverage they will offer repairs to you and your vehicle, wait let me see so you can ask them to waive this on the banking side but when it returns it’ll probably stop your auto pay ‘cause when we cut the auto pay off the system thinks it’s having problems but you can call us to make sure it’s functioning so you aren’t late for your next bill, don’t worry about it sir it happens to me too so i understand how that is if you have any other issues don’t hesitate to give us a call, can we choose where to get the repairs done or what’s the deal with that ‘cause insurance companies have different policies for that, i need to put in the pin you think it is first and then i can see if it goes in i’m more than happy to help you out here
reasons uh there can be an extension placed however i i don't see why there would be a reason for an extension here uhm you know sometimes there's extensions if there is deployment or or something of that nature, i don’t think there will be an extension here but they can be placed sometimes for deployment or things like that, don’t worry about it sir it happens to me too so i understand how that is if you have any other issues don’t hesitate to give us a call, i need to put in the pin you think it is first and then i can see if it goes in i’m more than happy to help you out here, i might now be able to email the information to you but i can definitely let you know the status, you may get a return payment fee but i can transfer you to the banking team since you’re with usaa and they can see what to do though they’ll probably tell you is to just let the fee charge and then they’ll return the money to you
sure now the only thing uh my next and last question i guess it would be is that uh do we get a choice of where we need to get the repairs done or how does that work 'cause i know all insurance companies are different, i need to put in the pin you think it is first and then i can see if it goes in i’m more than happy to help you out here, don’t worry about it sir it happens to me too so i understand how that is if you have any other issues don’t hesitate to give us a call, wait let me see so you can ask them to waive this on the banking side but when it returns it’ll probably stop your auto pay ‘cause when we cut the auto pay off the system thinks it’s having problems but you can call us to make sure it’s functioning so you aren’t late for your next bill, open it once you get it to let me know it looks good so you won’t need to call back, i can definitely help you and just to make sure i’ve got the right account what is your full name
or sometimes they can issue payment in your name and um have it deposited or mailed to you uhm for you to take those funds and have the vehicle repaired at a at any facility of your choice, sometimes they will deposit or mail the money to you so you can take the funds and repair your car at any facility you choose, you may get a return payment fee but i can transfer you to the banking team since you’re with usaa and they can see what to do though they’ll probably tell you is to just let the fee charge and then they’ll return the money to you, wait let me see so you can ask them to waive this on the banking side but when it returns it’ll probably stop your auto pay ‘cause when we cut the auto pay off the system thinks it’s having problems but you can call us to make sure it’s functioning so you aren’t late for your next bill, once i’m in your account i can give you a temporary pin and afterwards you can make your own we can do it like that, when the card’s prompted nothing will go through until we reactivate it but if your charges are valid i can reactivate the card and it won’t give you anymore trouble
uh you know parties who call in such as yourself who's not with usaa so that way i can fully explain everything that's going to happen you know 'cause some people some people don't understand it as easily as you did so [laughter] but i'm very happy to educate anyone, i like talking to people like you who aren’t with usaa so i can explain what’ll happen ‘cause some people don’t get it as readily as you did, don’t worry about it sir it happens to me too so i understand how that is if you have any other issues don’t hesitate to give us a call, open it once you get it to let me know it looks good so you won’t need to call back, okay thank you how can i get the tracking information for that because usaa said they would email it to me but never did, let’s see what we can do for you here
right yeah i'm sure everything's gonna be uhm this is not my first rodeo i've been hit believe it or not twice last year [laughter], i’m not worried this isn’t the first time this has happened to me i was hit two times last year if you can believe it, i need to put in the pin you think it is first and then i can see if it goes in i’m more than happy to help you out here, open it once you get it to let me know it looks good so you won’t need to call back, i can definitely help you and just to make sure i’ve got the right account what is your full name, i can pay it all at once if I get the money next month
so first of those quick additional questions are there any other licensed operators in the household besides yourself that should be insured on this policy, quick question are there any other licensed drivers living with you who should be insured on this policy, can we choose where to get the repairs done or what’s the deal with that ‘cause insurance companies have different policies for that, they’ll contact our insured and the driver theresa to get the information you just gave us and a recorded statement of what happened and how to assess liability and when liability is assessed if our driver is at fault and there’s adequate coverage they will offer repairs to you and your vehicle, do we need to list anyone as an additional insured, wait let me see so you can ask them to waive this on the banking side but when it returns it’ll probably stop your auto pay ‘cause when we cut the auto pay off the system thinks it’s having problems but you can call us to make sure it’s functioning so you aren’t late for your next bill
no we yes yes we have an online account it's all set up and everything we just i was trying to log in on the app i like i haven't logged in at all like my username and password i don't know what that is 'cause we've set this up and done so many different things i just don't know what my username and password are, we have an online account set up i was trying to log in on the app and i haven’t logged in before ‘causei don’t know what my username and password is, i tried resetting my username by clicking the forgot username and when it prompted me to enter my phone number linked to the account i put me and my husband’s number and it wouldn’t recognize either of them, i can definitely help you and just to make sure i’ve got the right account what is your full name, i might now be able to email the information to you but i can definitely let you know the status, hey i need to make sure my insurances are listed on the new address i just changed usaa just notified me to call in

okay so a lot of people get confused even though you have joint accounts um each member has their own online access, a lot of people don’t know that even if you have a joint account each member has their own access online, i like talking to people like you who aren’t with usaa so i can explain what’ll happen ‘cause some people don’t get it as readily as you did, wait let me see so you can ask them to waive this on the banking side but when it returns it’ll probably stop your auto pay ‘cause when we cut the auto pay off the system thinks it’s having problems but you can call us to make sure it’s functioning so you aren’t late for your next bill, okay thank you how can i get the tracking information for that because usaa said they would email it to me but never did, i can definitely help you and just to make sure i’ve got the right account what is your full name
yeah it prompted it so anything after that until we reactivate the card it's not gonna go through but if you'resaying those are active and valid chargesi can just reactivate the card and you should have no other trouble, when the card’s prompted nothing will go through until we reactivate it but if your charges are valid i can reactivate the card and it won’t give you anymore trouble, wait let me see so you can ask them to waive this on the banking side but when it returns it’ll probably stop your auto pay ‘cause when we cut the auto pay off the system thinks it’s having problems but you can call us to make sure it’s functioning so you aren’t late for your next bill, i need to put in the pin you think it is first and then i can see if it goes in i’m more than happy to help you out here, the last thing you need to do is e sign the loan documents and then it will automatically get it ready from there, open it once you get it to let me know it looks good so you won’t need to call back
oh no i wanna switch it so instead of it coming out of my checking account i wanted to use my credit card because i just realized that it's more than what i thought it was gonna be, i wanna switch it from my checking account to my credit card ‘cause it’s more than i thought it would be, i need to put in the pin you think it is first and then i can see if it goes in i’m more than happy to help you out here, i was a little alarmed when i got this alert and they mentioned my daughter and son in law who called and had no idea so i wanna make sure this is not regarding my account, i am calling you guys before i call her to see if i need to change my card again, i was on the line with a guy and i don’t know if he put me on hold while he was checking something ‘cause the recording came on and then i lost him i dunno if he’s still on the other line
