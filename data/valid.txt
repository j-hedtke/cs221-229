i was i was so careful and i'm sure that i hit the pin and it's very familiar to me because it was an address of a place that i lived, i put the pin in so carefully and i’m sure of it because it is the address of a previous residence 


okay so i'm more than happy to help you out it's asking for your pin give me the pin you think it is and i can try and put it in, i need to put in the pin you think it is first and then i can see if it goes in i’m more than happy to help you out here


i can't even get into your account i need to have somebody authenticate you so i can get into your account, someone will need to authenticate you so i can unlock your account because i cannot access your account


no so if i came into the money like the next month i could just pay it right off, i can pay it all at once if I get the money next month 


_______________________________________


and then do you know your gross income and i can do that annually monthly twice a month whatever's easiest for you, what is your income either per year or every month or bimonthly whatever way is easiest 


mean if you can uh i guess is january too soon [laughter] you could do at the end of the month too okay alright let's do february seventeenth on, you can do it at the end of january or if that’s too soon then let’s do the seventeenth of february 


i think i'll be able to go i'll be able to go online to and see these automatic payments already hooked up and everything right, will i see the automatic payments plugged in already when i go online 


okay so yeah that's all that's left to do now is just for you to go on and e sign the loan documents and then the whole process will go from there it'll automatically start uhm getting it ready to put it in there, the last thing you need to do is e sign the loan documents and then it will automatically get it ready from there 


uhm do you do you want me to stay on the line just in case if if it's having issues when you're trying to sign or, i can stay on the line with you while you’re signing in case it gives you a problem 


hey how's it going yeah i uh i just recently saw that my address was still on my old address and i changed it through usaa and it it prompted me and said that i may need to call and make sure my my insurances are also on the new address, hey i need to make sure my insurances are listed on the new address i just changed usaa just notified me to call in 


uhm i'm still hoping that <unk> if it wasn't raining i would take my motorcycle just bypass all the the traffic that's usually what i do when i drive to sac, when i drive to sacramento and isn’t raining i take my motorcycle to get around all the traffic 


alright so what is this new address that we speak of, what’s your new address 


yeah [laughter] well we'll we'll see uh it might get bumped up to that soon just because of the uh i just got hired in atwater so i might have to commute to atwater , my mileage might increase soon because i might need to commute to atwater for work 


so i don't have any idea what card or what's happening with it so i can't even really tell you more than <unk> i got a fraud alert from you guys, i got a fraud alert from usaa and i have no idea what card it is for or what’s going on 


_______________________________________


right so i just i kind of figured out that this might be on your credit card account so i'm going to get you verified and identified through the system, i need to verify and identify you through the system ‘cause I just realized this might be on your credit card account 


but it just startled me when they were when i got this and then you know i got the call about my daughter and son in law and they called and they said they had no idea so i wanted to make sure it wasn't on my account, i was a little alarmed when i got this alert and they mentioned my daughter and son in law who called and had no idea so i wanna make sure this is not regarding my account 


so this is uh your account is still active and available for immediate use your card is a normal status i don't see any security alerts um or um recent transactions that are pending so you haven't used your credit card today at all correct, i don’t see any security alerts or recent transactions on your card which is in normal status and your account is active and able to be used right now you haven’t used your card today right 


is it uh possibly that you may have your phone number on um their account somehow, is it possible your phone number might be on their account 


but uhm i was like no let me before i call her let me call you guys to see if i need to change my card yet again, i am calling you guys before i call her to see if i need to change my card again 


i can barely hear you let me bump up the volume, i can’t hear you let me turn the volume up 


[laughter] not a problem sir it happens to me all the time so i know how it goes if you need any help from us sir feel free to give us a call back okay, don’t worry about it sir it happens to me too so i understand how that is if you have any other issues don’t hesitate to give us a call 
they're saying they didn't get it and they're still gonna charge me for my insurance, they’re still charging me for my insurance ‘cus they say they didn’t get what i sent 


they're aware they totaled the car right, do they know that they totaled the car 


super wild okay and then they're now they're also requesting uhm a declarations page for your um new policy here at usaa is that right, okay that’s crazy and now they’re asking for a declarations page for your new policy here at usaa right 


__________________________________________


they should have record of the total loss i'm just really confused by why they're they're making it such a hard time for you, i don’t know why they’re making it so difficult for you they should have the total loss on record 


and then uh 'cause but they won't take anything directly from me everything has to go through freeway insurance, they won’t take anything straight from me it all has to go through freeway insurance 


i just i just wanted to be done with them and i feel frustrated because i can't get done [laughter], i’m frustrated because i just wanna be done with them but i can’t get done 


and brian's on that policy right, is brian on the policy 


okay will you email that to me so i can forward it to i'm just gonna forward it to them directly even though they say that they won't take it, they say they won’t take an email but i’m just gonna forward it to them will you send that to me 


it says both of our names on there it says jeep it says all that stuff on there, it has all the information on it like both our names and jeep


hi linda uhm i'm i'm just calling to see if uh my debit my new debit card got mailed and if they did it expedited or they did it regularly, hi linda i wanna know if my new debit card got mailed already and whether it is expedited or regular mail 


okay i'm not sure i can email you the information but i'll be happy to share any status that i have with you, i might now be able to email the information to you but i can definitely let you know the status 


okay for sure thank you so much and there's no way i can find out the tracking information on that 'cause they said they were gonna email me but i never got an email from usaa about that, okay thank you how can i get the tracking information for that because usaa said they would email it to me but never did 


okay no problem i can definitely assist you with transferring that money to your son uhm what account are we taking the money out of, i’m happy to help you get that money to your son what account will you be transferring it to him from 


__________________________________________


yeah definitely i'd be happy to assist you there uh i do you want to make sure i got the right account what's your first and last name, i can definitely help you and just to make sure i’ve got the right account what is your full name 


and uh i'll be asking a few questions to give you the best possible service there, to best assist you i will be asking a few additional questions 


and then i have a totally separate question after we get that done, after we finish with this i have a totally separate question 


and does anybody need to be listed as an additional insured, do we need to list anyone as an additional insured


what i'll do is i'll go ahead and send that off then i'm gonna actually have to review it first but you should get it within the next few minutes, i need to review that before i send it to you but you will get it in the next few minutes 


um and then once you get it uh let me know if you want to open it and let me know that it looks good for ya uhm so that way you don't have to call back, open it once you get it to let me know it looks good so you won’t need to call back 


<unk> when  that expires <unk> does that automatically just renew or do i have to call and do something, do i have to call when that expires of does it renew by itself 


yeah great question you actually never have to call to renew something it'll automatically renew unless you want it to cancel and then you just call us and tell us, it automatically renews so you don’t have to call unless you want it to cancel 


oh okay uh i was gonna say good news is once they get their learner permit they're not gonna increase the rates it's only when they get their driver's license, good news is the rate is not increased when they get their learner permit and is only increased when they get their license 


so in this case i mean she's just a young operator they're just gonna charge you like she was um gonna be involved in an accident until she can prove otherwise so unfortunately that's why it's so expensive, it’s expensive because she’s a young operator and they will charge you as if she’s gonna be in an accident until she can show otherwise 
i heard it's a it's a pretty good discount though if she takes the driving course right, if she takes the driving course i heard we save a lot of money 


i don't really want her touching my car but in an emergency though i mean she can she still drive it, i don’t want her to use my car but can she still drive it in an emergency 


so um it may incur a return payment fee and i can get you over to our banking team 'cause you are with usaa so i get you over our banking team and see if there's anything that they can do um probably what they're gonna tell you is to let it go through and then they'll return it, you may get a return payment fee but i can transfer you to the banking team since you’re with usaa and they can see what to do though they’ll probably tell you is to just let the fee charge and then they’ll return the money to you 


um you can ask them to waive it on the banking side but what i was gonna say was when it returns it'll probably well wait wait wait wait wait um let me see <unk> okay so when it returns it'll probably go ahead and um cut off your auto pay because whenever an account does it comes back and you know has the issue we cut off the auto pay <unk> the system just assumes it's you know broken so you can go ahead and just give us a call and just make sure everything's set up properly still so you don't end up going past due on the next bill okay, wait let me see so you can ask them to waive this on the banking side but when it returns it’ll probably stop your auto pay ‘cause when we cut the auto pay off the system thinks it’s having problems but you can call us to make sure it’s functioning so you aren’t late for your next bill 


um my parents actually have usaa and i was trying to get onto their insurance but they just called me or they just told me to call and quote it or see what i can do about doing that about getting on their insurance they just wanted me to find out what i needed to do or how to do that, my parents are usaa members and i wanna get on their insurance they told me to call and get a quote and see what i need to do 


okay i was just on with uh uh another gentleman and the the the uh recording came on about while you're on hold or whatever and i lost him so i don't know if he's still on the other line or or what but um [laughter] <unk> he was checking on something maybe he put me on hold and that came on i don't know, i was on the line with a guy and i don’t know if he put me on hold while he was checking something ‘cause the recording came on and then i lost him i dunno if he’s still on the other line 


were you talking to a female representative sir, was the representative you were talking to a woman 


yes hi i'm here trying to buy groceries but it's saying that my card declined but i have enough funds on it, my card is being declined here at the grocery store but i know i have enough money on it 


it's not putting it into the c d u your c d cannot be touched um it's making a payment to the credit card because you have a minimum that you're <unk> required to meet every month and it looks like you missed your minimum last month, this isn’t about the cd but you need to make a minimum payment to your credit card every month which is required every month and it looks like you missed it last month 


right until until your account is no longer delinquent we are restricting you from making any purchases, until you are in good standing we are blocking any purchases 


_______________________________________


deposit a check on my phone but it seemed that i don't have that option, i can’t deposit a check on my phone 


and it should say like add check i know it doesn't seem like um a button or anything but it should just have those words, it doesn’t look like a button but is says the words add check 


for my car loan tried to go through today uhm there wasn't enough money in in the account so i'm currently showing negative uhm in the account and the transaction is still pending, i didn’t have enough money in my account today for the car loan so my account is showing negative and the transaction is still pending 


so you're the third person that i talked to you so hopefully i don't get transferred again but, i’ve talked to three people already so hopefully i don’t get transferred again 


um however i was on the phone with them and i was on my lunch from my lunch break and i i had  to um i had to go back to work, i was on the phone with them during my lunch break but i had to get off the phone after that 


yesterday it worked fine and then today earlier today it was fine and now it i restarted it and then it asked to diagnose my problems and then after that it now it's wanting me to reset my p c so i'm not sure if it was damaged when i moved or anything like that but, my computer might have gotten messed up when i moved because it worked fine yesterday and earlier today but now that i restarted it it’s asking to diagnose my problems and reset it 


i haven't even opened the door yet because i'm worried that if i opened it 'cause it's all indentated that it may not close so i'm just leaving it as is, the door is all indentated and i’m not even opening it ‘cause i’m worried that it may not close so i’m leaving it alone 








as to what occurred and how it happened things like that they'll also reach out to our insured and theresa the driver as well to obtain the same information you know get a recorded statement as to what occurred and how it happened to help determine liability uh now if and when liability is determined if our driver is found to be at fault and there is the adequate coverages uh they would then offer repairs uh to you for your vehicle, they’ll contact our insured and the driver theresa to get the information you just gave us and a recorded statement of what happened and how to assess liability and when liability is assessed if our driver is at fault and there’s adequate coverage they will offer repairs to you and your vehicle 


reasons uh there can be an extension placed however i i don't see why there would be a reason for an extension here uhm you know sometimes there's extensions if there is deployment or or something of that nature, i don’t think there will be an extension here but they can be placed sometimes for deployment or things like that 


sure now the only thing uh my next and last question i guess it would be is that uh do we get a choice of where we need to get the repairs done or how does that work 'cause i know all insurance companies are different, can we choose where to get the repairs done or what’s the deal with that ‘cause insurance companies have different policies for that 


_________________________________


or sometimes they can issue payment in your name and um have it deposited or mailed to you uhm for you to take those funds and have the vehicle repaired at a at any facility of your choice, sometimes they will deposit or mail the money to you so you can take the funds and repair your car at any facility you choose 


uh you know parties who call in such as yourself who's not with usaa so that way i can fully explain everything that's going to happen you know 'cause some people some people don't understand it as easily as you did so [laughter] but i'm very happy to educate anyone, i like talking to people like you who aren’t with usaa so i can explain what’ll happen ‘cause some people don’t get it as readily as you did 


right yeah i'm sure everything's gonna be uhm this is not my first rodeo i've been hit believe it or not twice last year [laughter], i’m not worried this isn’t the first time this has happened to me i was hit two times last year if you can believe it 


so first of those quick additional questions are there any other licensed operators in the household besides yourself that should be insured on this policy, quick question are there any other licensed drivers living with you who should be insured on this policy 






no we yes yes we have an online account it's all set up and everything we just i was trying to log in on the app i like i haven't logged in at all like my username and password i don't know what that is 'cause we've set this up and done so many different things i just don't know what my username and password are, we have an online account set up i was trying to log in on the app and i haven’t logged in before ‘cause  i don’t know what my username and password is 


and when i try to like re like reset my username like saying that i forgot it like click the forgot username it has you type in like your phone number that’s linked to the account and i typed in me and my husband's phone number 'cause like it and it wouldn't recognize either of them, i tried resetting my username by clicking the forgot username and when it prompted me to enter my phone number linked to the account i put me and my husband’s number and it wouldn’t recognize either of them 


okay so a lot of people get confused even though you have joint accounts um each member has their own online access, a lot of people don’t know that even if you have a joint account each member has their own access online 


yeah it prompted it so anything after that until we reactivate the card it's not gonna go through but if you're  saying those are active and valid charges  i can just reactivate the card and you should have no other trouble, when the card’s prompted nothing will go through until we reactivate it but if your charges are valid i can reactivate the card and it won’t give you anymore trouble 


oh no i wanna switch it so instead of it coming out of my checking account i wanted to use my credit card because i just realized that it's more than what i thought it was gonna be, i wanna switch it from my checking account to my credit card ‘cause it’s more than i thought it would be
