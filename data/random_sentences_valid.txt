they said before i had a visa,In this section we demonstrate the workflow by training and testing a model for salt body interpretation
we could transfer money into my usaa checking account when i need it,The seismic image in this example is cropped from SEAM Phase synthetic dataset
may I have your name please,We selected crossline D slices as training data
last time i did it online,The training labels are manual annotations generated by an optimal path picking method
how may I help you,With a seismic amplitude image as input the network should identify the entire salt body as a probability map output starting from a seed point We set the FoV size for D salt body interpretation to x
thank you for choosing usaa,Although it is a relatively small size compared to x the size of the target the movement of the FoV should be able to cover the entirety of the salt body
my debit card keeps getting refused,In the network we downsample the inputs times with x max pooling every convolutional layers in the encoder section and symmetrically upsample in the decoder section
let me take a look and see here,Since the dimension of the inputs is downsampled x in total before upsampling the FoV is zeropadded to x and cropped to the original size at the final output In order to train the model to move the FoV effectively within the geobody we adopt a dynamic subregion scheme to constrain the movements of the FoV during training
I need to put a travel notification on my card,A limited number of subregions are randomly sampled from each training image so that all subregions are centered within the valid geobody
Id be more than happy to help you,In the first epoch subregions share the same size with the FoV so the network only learns how to segment the input image without actually moving the FoV
well see its like my mom and stepdad have verizon they were asking me the benefits for cricket,After that the subregions grow in size until hitting the x limit on each new epoch
yes i am hoping you can help me uhm i have uh an auto policy with you guys,This way the network gradually learns to move the FoV based on previous segmentation results further and further away from the starting point
no but fortunately for me i worked at a university not for the government,We train the model for epochs and use area under the curve as the metric to determine the matching performance of the prediction likelihood against the ground truth The training took less than hours with a GTX Ti GPU
it could just be that it hasnt fully processed yet cause we do a lot of batching at our batching starts at midnight,Note that because the FoV cannot move outside the image boundary FoV centers could not cover the entire range of the picked fault however the segmentation of that fault is already completed and floodfilling can continue as shown in Figure Figure show examples of picking only one fault instance with other faults in the vicinity
um i do see that you have a birthday coming up so id like to wish you a happy early birthday i hope you have a wonderful time,Figure shows tracking history when the seed point is put on the middle fault and in Figure the floodfilling can continue to fill up the entire instance
well let me get into your account i can send you a temporary pin and then you can change it we can do it that way,Figure show similar processes but start with different seed points to the left and right side of the one in Figure
i was i was so careful and im sure that i hit the pin and its very familiar to me because it was an address of a place that i lived,In Figure even though the seed point is slightly off from the correct fault position floodfilling can automatically correct to align with the fault
okay so im more than happy to help you out its asking for your pin give me the pin you think it is and i can try and put it in,Note that although the tracking is focused on one of the many faults the output fault likelihood maps overlaid on the background image show that the model is still aware of the other faults in the vicinity depending on the size of the FoV
i cant even get into your account i need to have somebody authenticate you so i can get into your account,Figure shows all three fault instances generated in Figure
no so if i came into the money like the next month i could just pay it right off,This demonstrates the ability to separate geobody instances with the same attribute Although all examples are in D the transfer of this concept to D is straightforward and requires trivial effort
and then do you know your gross income and i can do that annually monthly twice a month whatevers easiest for you,In D the proposed workflow can be more computationally efficient than the traditional sliding window scheme
mean if you can uh i guess is january too soon laughter you could do at the end of the month too okay alright lets do february seventeenth on,In addition to the salt body and fault interpretation the proposed method can be additionally suitable for D channel tracking On the other hand the proposed method may not perform well in the case of trying to separate instances that overlap
i think ill be able to go ill be able to go online to and see these automatic payments already hooked up and everything right,This is due to the fact that each FoV search for the proposal for the next movement in all directions equally in order to fill the geobody space
okay so yeah thats all thats left to do now is just for you to go on and e sign the loan documents and then the whole process will go from there itll automatically start uhm getting it ready to put it in there,However show that deep learning can predict not only geobody likelihood but also relevant attributes fault dip and strike angle
uhm do you do you want me to stay on the line just in case if if its having issues when youre trying to sign or,It is worth investigating to utilize these important directional attributes in deep learning interpretation methods such as guiding the floodfilling search pattern so that overlapping instances can be separated
hey hows it going yeah i uh i just recently saw that my address was still on my old address and i changed it through usaa and it it prompted me and said that i may need to call and make sure my my insurances are also on the new address,Figure shows the predicted results after implementing prediction on the whole dataset by using trained model From Figure high accuracy can be seen on the sections used for training and sections in the neighborhood
uhm im still hoping that unk if it wasnt raining i would take my motorcycle just bypass all the the traffic thats usually what i do when i drive to sac,Both positions and boundaries of seismic facies are generally predicted correctly
alright so what is this new address that we speak of,It is obvious that prediction on training sections such as inline achieves high similarity to label images although some tiny details need better prediction Several seismic facies are predicted particularly precisely in Figure for example high amplitude continuous grizzly high amplitude and salt dome
yeah laughter well well well see uh it might get bumped up to that soon just because of the uh i just got hired in atwater so i might have to commute to atwater ,It takes hours minutes in training and only seconds in onesection prediction on two NVIDIA Tesla Km GPUs Compared with CNNs applied for seismic facies interpretation our scheme significantly reduces computational time in training and predicting
so i dont have any idea what card or whats happening with it so i cant even really tell you more than unk i got a fraud alert from you guys,Meanwhile seismic facies are classified more accurately by DeepLabv
right so i just i kind of figured out that this might be on your credit card account so im going to get you verified and identified through the system,Compared with simple encoderdecoder models in seismic facies interpretation our scheme predicts more accurate results for encoding multiscale information and decoding more details Good performance can be observed even in crossline sections timeslice sections and the inline sections far from training sections as shown in Figure
but it just startled me when they were when i got this and then you know i got the call about my daughter and son in law and they called and they said they had no idea so i wanted to make sure it wasnt on my account,These predicted sections are randomly extracted from the predicted data cube And note that the size of each training slice is Ud while data sections to be predicted are at size Ud
so this is uh your account is still active and available for immediate use your card is a normal status i dont see any security alerts um or um recent transactions that are pending so you havent used your credit card today at all correct,It means that DeepLabv is flexible in size during training and predicting We propose an effective scheme for automatic seismic facies interpretation by utilizing DeepLabv
is it uh possibly that you may have your phone number on um their account somehow,This enhanced encoderdecoder structure produces more accurate pixellevel predictions by extracting multiscale features and recovering more details
but uhm i was like no let me before i call her let me call you guys to see if i need to change my card yet again,And this scheme reduces weights to significantly improve efficiency
i can barely hear you let me bump up the volume,The implementation on F dataset shows its good performance in seismic facies interpretation
laughter not a problem sir it happens to me all the time so i know how it goes if you need any help from us sir feel free to give us a call back okay,Furthermore the well predicted results indicate huge potentials in seismic interpretation using DeepLabv
theyre saying they didnt get it and theyre still gonna charge me for my insurance,Seismic facies commonly indicate types of lithological association and sedimentary characteristics of geological bodies
theyre aware they totaled the car right,The interpretation of seismic facies provides a reference for analyzing subsurface geological conditions
super wild okay and then theyre now theyre also requesting uhm a declarations page for your um new policy here at usaa is that right,Conventional seismic interpretation methods usually require a lot of manual works and the interpretation results are inevitably affected by some subjective factors
they should have record of the total loss im just really confused by why theyre theyre making it such a hard time for you,To address these issues deep learning has drawn a lot of attention in recent years Research in deep learning has made significant progress in several fields such as computer vision
and then uh cause but they wont take anything directly from me everything has to go through freeway insurance,Considering the similarity between seismic interpretation and computer vision many researchers adopt computer vision algorithms to analyze and understand subsurface structures
i just i just wanted to be done with them and i feel frustrated because i cant get done laughter,Convolutional neural networks are commonly considered to solve seismic interpretation problems such as faults identification salt dome prediction and seismic facies interpretation
and brians on that policy right,However CNN has a fatal shortage that CNN merely predicts imagewise classification results instead of pixelwise results
okay will you email that to me so i can forward it to im just gonna forward it to them directly even though they say that they wont take it,Although dense prediction can be achieved by performing classification using CNN models on small patches of data to infer the class label at the patch center it is inaccurate and computationally timeconsuming The FCN model developed from CNN inspires researchers to establish encoderdecoder structures for semantic segmentation tasks
it says both of our names on there it says jeep it says all that stuff on there,These structures are specially designed for dense predictions because they can predict pixellevel outputs in real time
hi linda uhm im im just calling to see if uh my debit my new debit card got mailed and if they did it expedited or they did it regularly,The encoder similar to a CNN model is used to extract features to obtain feature maps and the decoder similar to a deconvolution operation is used to recover feature maps to the original size and predict outputs
okay im not sure i can email you the information but ill be happy to share any status that i have with you,Simple encoderdecoder models have been implemented in salt dome detection and facies interpretation DeepLabv is an enhanced encoderdecoder structure that achieves a stateoftheart performance on PASCAL VOC and Cityscapes datasets
okay for sure thank you so much and theres no way i can find out the tracking information on that cause they said they were gonna email me but i never got an email from usaa about that,This structure performs higher accuracy than simple encoderdecoder models by applying Atrous spatial pyramid pooling module and a simple yet effective decoder module
okay no problem i can definitely assist you with transferring that money to your son uhm what account are we taking the money out of,By utilizing depthwise separable convolution DeepLabv can reduce a lot of weights and greatly improve the efficiency
yeah definitely id be happy to assist you there uh i do you want to make sure i got the right account whats your first and last name,In this paper we propose a scheme for seismic facies interpretation using DeepLabv After implementing effective data augmentation to generate diversity training samples we perform DeepLabv to extract multiscale features of seismic facies and recover more details in prediction results
and uh ill be asking a few questions to give you the best possible service there,By tuning parameters the application of our scheme on F dataset demonstrates good performance for high accuracy and efficiency After data augmentation we obtain thousands of diversity data slices at crop size Ud or Ud
and then i have a totally separate question after we get that done,All data slices are set as training data and the training sections without being cropped are set as evaluation data
and does anybody need to be listed as an additional insured,Test data and data for predicting are also complete seismic sections without being cropped in slices
what ill do is ill go ahead and send that off then im gonna actually have to review it first but you should get it within the next few minutes,We test several sets of parameters including base learning rate data crop size atrous rates in ASPP module output stride and number of data slices for training after data augmentation
um and then once you get it uh let me know if you want to open it and let me know that it looks good for ya uhm so that way you dont have to call back,These parameters may affect prediction for training the encoderdecoder structure The performance is measured by mean intersection over union across the facies Higher value of mIoU represents better performance
unk whenthat expires unk does that automatically just renew or do i have to call and do something,The details and quantitative comparison results are listed in Table By comprehensive comparison of prediction results under different parameters a set of parameters for performing best both in accuracy and efficiency are selected as the final scheme
yeah great question you actually never have to call to renew something itll automatically renew unless you want it to cancel and then you just call us and tell us,We train data slices on DeepLabv with base learning rate data crop size and atrous rates with output stride
oh okay uh i was gonna say good news is once they get their learner permit theyre not gonna increase the rates its only when they get their drivers license,In we proposed a method for automatically obtaining large amounts of weaklylabeled data using two main steps similaritybased retrieval and weaklysupervised label mapping
so in this case i mean shes just a young operator theyre just gonna charge you like she was um gonna be involved in an accident until she can prove otherwise so unfortunately thats why its so expensive,The only requirement is for the interpreter to define the various classes by selecting at least one exemplar image for every class
i heard its a its a pretty good discount though if she takes the driving course right,Due to the limited space we provide a brief explanation only and we refer to our previous work for the details Similaritybased retrieval takes exemplar images for each seismic facies like the ones shown in Figure and then retrieves thousands of images with similar facies to the exemplar images In our work two exemplar images for every class were sufficient
i dont really want her touching my car but in an emergency though i mean she can she still drive it,Figure shows the exemplar images for different facies from our recently released dataset and shows a small subset of the retrieved images for every class
so um it may incur a return payment fee and i can get you over to our banking team cause you are with usaa so i get you over our banking team and see if theres anything that they can do um probably what theyre gonna tell you is to let it go through and then theyll return it,In this work we retrieve images for every class of seismic facies Given the retrieved images the weaklysupervised label mapping algorithm learns the common features in each class and then uses these common features to predict the pixellevel labels for all the retrieved images
um you can ask them to waive it on the banking side but what i was gonna say was when it returns itll probably well wait wait wait wait wait um let me see unk okay so when it returns itll probably go ahead and um cut off your auto pay because whenever an account does it comes back and you know has the issue we cut off the auto pay unk the system just assumes its you know broken so you can go ahead and just give us a call and just make sure everythings set up properly still so you dont end up going past due on the next bill okay,Figure shows the label mapping results for various images
um my parents actually have usaa and i was trying to get onto their insurance but they just called me or they just told me to call and quote it or see what i can do about doing that about getting on their insurance they just wanted me to find out what i needed to do or how to do that,The label mapping algorithm also produces confidence values denoted q in each label it predicts
okay i was just on with uh uh another gentleman and the the the uh recording came on about while youre on hold or whatever and i lost him so i dont know if hes still on the other line or or what but um laughter unk he was checking on something maybe he put me on hold and that came on i dont know,In the next subsection we explain how these confidence values are used in the network loss function of our weaklysupervised models To train and test our different models we use our recently released facies classification dataset
were you talking to a female representative sir,This dataset includes six different lithostratigraphic classes from the Netherlands F block
yes hi im here trying to buy groceries but its saying that my card declined but i have enough funds on it,There are the Upper Middle and Lower North Sea groups in addition to the RijnlandChalk Scruff and Zechstein groups
its not putting it into the c d u your c d cannot be touched um its making a payment to the credit card because you have a minimum that youre unk required to meet every month and it looks like you missed your minimum last month,Figure shows a D view of the survey with the Scruff and Zechstein groups visible
right until until your account is no longer delinquent we are restricting you from making any purchases,We use patches extracted from the NW region of the survey for training and we test our models on test set and as shown in Figure For a fair comparison between strongly and weaklysupervised models we use the same underlying architecture for both
deposit a check on my phone but it seemed that i dont have that option,We use an encoderdecoder style architecture similar to SegNet
and it should say like add check i know it doesnt seem like um a button or anything but it should just have those words,This architecture performs well for semantic segmentation tasks and outputs a prediction that matches the size of the network input
for my car loan tried to go through today uhm there wasnt enough money in in the account so im currently showing negative uhm in the account and the transaction is still pending,In our case the output predictions are six patches corresponding the six different classes in our dataset
so youre the third person that i talked to you so hopefully i dont get transferred again but,In addition to the baseline case we also test the same models with data augmentation and skip connections
um however i was on the phone with them and i was on my lunch from my lunch break and i i hadto um i had to go back to work,We use of our training data for validation and we train all our models until convergence
yesterday it worked fine and then today earlier today it was fine and now it i restarted it and then it asked to diagnose my problems and then after that it now its wanting me to reset my p c so im not sure if it was damaged when i moved or anything like that but,We then apply these models on the two test sets in a sliding window fashion and average the resulting heat maps for the six classes
i havent even opened the door yet because im worried that if i opened it cause its all indentated that it may not close so im just leaving it as is,Finally we compute our evaluation metrics on both test sets and report the results in Table We use several metrics to evaluate our models
as to what occurred and how it happened things like that theyll also reach out to our insured and theresa the driver as well to obtain the same information you know get a recorded statement as to what occurred and how it happened to help determine liability uh now if and when liability is determined if our driver is found to be at fault and there is the adequate coverages uh they would then offer repairs uh to you for your vehicle,Namely pixel accuracy class accuracy for each individual class mean class accuracy which averages the CA score for all classes and frequencyweighted intersection over union These metrics are detailed in Figure shows sample results from inline in test set for both our strongly and weaklysupervised models
reasons uh there can be an extension placed however i i dont see why there would be a reason for an extension here uhm you know sometimes theres extensions if there is deployment or or something of that nature,Also Table summarizes the objective results that we have obtained In the stronglysupervised model adding skip connections and augmentation to the baseline both helped improve the results over the baseline model
sure now the only thing uh my next and last question i guess it would be is that uh do we get a choice of where we need to get the repairs done or how does that work cause i know all insurance companies are different,We note that in Figure the stronglysupervised results are rather good except for the two models This involves randomly rotating every training patch by up to adding random Gaussian noise and randomly flipping the training patches horizontally confusing the features in the Scruff class with the ones in the Upper North Sea class
or sometimes they can issue payment in your name and um have it deposited or mailed to you uhm for you to take those funds and have the vehicle repaired at a at any facility of your choice,Sectionbased models that train on the entire section not only patches can help remedy this issue On the other hand our preliminary weaklysupervised results show that using data augmentation and increasing the value of g to let the network focus on harder misclassified regions can help improve the results
uh you know parties who call in such as yourself whos not with usaa so that way i can fully explain everything thats going to happen you know cause some people some people dont understand it as easily as you did so laughter but im very happy to educate anyone,Furthermore when we weigh the loss function of each image by its similarity to the exemplar image used to retrieve it we can also improve the PA and FWIU scores by about
right yeah im sure everythings gonna be uhm this is not my first rodeo ive been hit believe it or not twice last year laughter,There are several ways where these weaklysupervised results can be improved this includes the use of more data augmentation during training and testing adding regularization to the network to prevent it from overfitting to the weak labels and better exploitation of side information such as confidence and similarity values
so first of those quick additional questions are there any other licensed operators in the household besides yourself that should be insured on this policy,Finally we note that our weaklysupervised results are still preliminary ones and better weaklysupervised results will be shared in the presentation
no we yes yes we have an online account its all set up and everything we just i was trying to log in on the app i like i havent logged in at all like my username and password i dont know what that is cause weve set this up and done so many different things i just dont know what my username and password are,We use the recently released facies classification benchmark to train and test various strongly and weaklysupervised models for facies classification
and when i try to like re like reset my username like saying that i forgot it like click the forgot username it has you type in like your phone number thats linked to the account and i typed in me and my husbands phone number cause like it and it wouldnt recognize either of them,We compare the results and these models to study the practicality of using weaklysupervised models for facies classification
okay so a lot of people get confused even though you have joint accounts um each member has their own online access,The weaklysupervised models only require two images annotated on the imagelevel compared to our stronglysupervised models that used fullyannotated seismic inlines for training
yeah it prompted it so anything after that until we reactivate the card its not gonna go through but if youresaying those are active and valid chargesi can just reactivate the card and you should have no other trouble,Naturally the stronglysupervised models perform better than weaklysupervised ones While our weaklysupervised results are encouraging given the minimal amount of annotated data they require we still believe more research is needed to help minimize the performance gap between weakly and stronglysupervised models
oh no i wanna switch it so instead of it coming out of my checking account i wanted to use my credit card because i just realized that its more than what i thought it was gonna be,For both models we experiment with using data augmentation to artificially increase the size of the training set Data augmentation applies different labelpreserving transformations to the training data such as rotation random horizontal flipping and the addition of Gaussian noise
